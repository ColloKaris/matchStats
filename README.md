## matchstats
This is a node js application that takes a CSV file with results from the premier league. It then parses that data, analyzes it, and generates a report.

This project was developed to familiarize myself with object-oriented programming in Node.js and TypeScript. It also implements SOLID coding practices. The projectâ€™s code is designed with reusability in mind.

I am yet to implement the frontend.

To use the application, install the dependencies, the run npm start.
